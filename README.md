**Instructions:**

In the WaiDatathon 2021, you will work in teams to analyze the datasets to answer problem statements of your choice relevant to the theme and present your findings on the final day of the event. Work together and focus on the big picture. Remember, the point of the WaiDatathon 2021 is to make our world a better place!

## Tentative schedule

**Morning:**
- Define our goals as a team for the competition (e.g., solving the world's problem, learning something, ...)
- Have an overview look at the data together
- define scientific questions (what do we try to predict? which specific problem(s) do we tackle?)
- decide type of output (report, notebook, poster?, infographics, model)
- decide methods (excell, matlab, python)
- assign individual tasks
- setup everybody's computer and decide on a workflow (e.g. github, etc...)

**Afternoon:**
- Get the job done. Either all together around a single computer or we split up the tasks or research questions into smaller groups.

## Typical tasks for a data science project
- Define background/objectives
- Describe the data, look for missing values, etc...
- clean the data (deal with missing values, types etc...)
- data exploration, visualization, look for correlations, identify important parameters
- data preprocessing (e.g. decorrelation, dimension reduction)
- statistical modeling
- predictive modeling?
- Clean up and put the results together
