# Domestic violence: risk factors and diagnostic using explainable AI

This repository contains material related to our submission for the WaiDatathon 2021 in which we earned the first place.
This datathon was organized by Women in AI on the theme ["Combat Domestic Violence with Data & AI"](https://www.womeninai.co/waidatathon-details). You can watch our 5-minute competition talk [here](https://lnkd.in/gBupkte).

## Content

This repository contains:

- `Presentation_Wai_Finals.pdf`: slides of our presentation at the WaiDatathon event
- `Presentation_MLT`: slides of presentation, invited by the community [Machine Learning Tokyo](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo)
- `report.ipynb`: a python3 jupyter notebook report that summarizes our findings and reproduces the results. The report contains in slightly different results than competition presentation for a few reasons:

    - data copyright
    - some competition figures were produced with R instead of python
    - some competition figures layout was edited in a vector graphics software
    - we added some figures or made existing ones interactive.
- `./Data/`: 
    - `ZZIR62FL.*`: the model dataset from the [DHS program](dhsprogram.com)
    - `DHS_summary_world.csv` data generated using the DHS [STATcompiler](STATcompiler.com) tool.
    - `iso_alpha_list.csv`: list ISO_ALPHA_3 standard country codes (for visualization).
