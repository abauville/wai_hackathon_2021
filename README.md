Women in AI Hackathon 2021: "Combat domestic violence with data and AI"

## Tentative schedule

**Morning:**
- Define our objective for the competition (learning, final product etc...)
- Have an overview look at the data together
- define scientific questions (what do we try to predict? which specific problem(s) do we tackle?)
- decide type of output (report, notebook, poster?, infographics, model)
- decide methods (excell, matlab, python)
- assign individual tasks
- setup everybody's computer and decide on a workflow (e.g. github, etc...)

**Afternoon:**
- Get the job done. Either all together around a single computer or we split up the tasks or research questions into smaller groups.

## Typical tasks for a data science project
- Define background/objectives
- Describe the data, look for missing values, etc...
- clean the data (deal with missing values, types etc...)
- data exploration, visualization, look for correlations, identify important parameters
- data preprocessing (e.g. decorrelation, dimension reduction)
- statistical modeling
- predictive modeling?
- Clean up and put the results together
